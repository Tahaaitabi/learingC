# What is an array

An array in C is a contiguous block of memory in which elements of the same type live.

# General syntax

`type varName[byte-size];`

Here's an array of 5 integers:

`int numbers[5];`

Here's an array of 5 characters:

`char characters[5];`

# Types of Arrays

There are two ways of defining and declaring arrays:

1 -Statically.
2 -Dynamically.

Static arrays live on the stack.
Dynamic arrays live on the heap and have to be allocated memory and once no longer needed they have to be deallocated from that memory block.
